Pebble KB

WIP (pc) keyboard to (musical) keyboard layout assigner with brain training potential

### Pebble KB - A better way to play simple songs on your keyboard & pro-brain-structuring & ambidexterity-promoting &  a potential brain rehab utility + a layout structure for further concept development

I recently went about remapping keys on my 60% GK61 with Gateron Optical Red switches, which have uniquely crisp, precise & repeatable actuation (esp when modded with o-rings). The end result is a splendid user musical brain training experience, which acted to the effect of nourishing a lead ravaged brain to the point of ambidexterity and 145 WAIS IV symbol search IQ score within a month of use, effectively palpable improvements to brain health and acuity. The key mapping devised is mirrored snaking across lower 2 keyboard rows, with black keys across top row.

C4 on right of keyboard, C3 on left of keyboard. h -> n - > j = C4 + D4 + E4 ... and g -> v -> f = C3 + D3 + E3 ...
Black keys are mapped similarly: y -> u -> i = C4^# + D4^# + F4^# ... and t -> r -> e = C3^# + D3^# + F3^# ...

By the way, some usage instructions:
Between song trials, spam press large key equivalents, sometimes left hand, left side, right hand, right side, always doing both hands, sometimes left hand, right side, right hand, left side.
Try to play the song with each hand side at some point, starting right side. At some point, introduce intra-song side switching, so for a given note pick left or right side and swap side during song.
Also, can count ABCs or 123 as you advance during song.

Pairs excellently with this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVLFrziDSvg

I found bliss, plus palpable progress in ability to maintain tempo using Pebble KB when I later added a quality mini piano and reliable USB extension (connected to USB 2 port). Prior to beginning use with Pebble KB, I seriously struggled to find my place on piano. Now I can get through at least beginner music.
